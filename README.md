## ✨ What’s This Repo?

This is a collection of projects I’ve built while learning, experimenting, or trying out new ideas.  
It brings together everything from API development and cloud-native tools to fun little side projects and frontend practice.

Some are full-blown backend systems with solid architecture. Others are smaller, focused on specific concepts like testing, containerization, CI/CD, or simply exploring new frameworks.

## 📁 Project Types

### 🧠 Backend & Systems

Projects focused on backend architecture, APIs, clean code, scalability, and real-world patterns.

- **Languages:** Java (Spring Boot), Python (FastAPI/Flask), Go (Gin/Fiber), TypeScript (NestJS)
- **Topics:** REST & GraphQL, authentication, testing (unit/integration), observability, DDD, event-driven design

---

### ☁️ Cloud & DevOps

Projects where I explore cloud infrastructure, automation, and platform engineering tools.

- **Tools:** Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, Terraform, GitHub Actions
- **Clouds:** AWS, GCP, Azure
- **What I build:** CI/CD pipelines, IaC setups, containerized apps, cluster configs, monitoring dashboards

---

### 🧪 Mini Projects & Playground

Small experiments or utilities — quick ideas I wanted to try or skills I was sharpening.

- Shell scripts, CLI tools, automation, random APIs, architecture tests

---

### 🎨 Frontend Challenges (Bonus!)

While backend is my main focus, I occasionally enjoy UI challenges too.

- Platforms: Frontend Mentor and others
- Tech: HTML, CSS, TypeScript
